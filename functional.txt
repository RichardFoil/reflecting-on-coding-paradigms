How does this solution ensure data immutability?

This function insures data immuatablitity by not allowing any data or items to be overwritten or changed.
This function only allows data to be appened to a flattend array.

Is this solution a pure function? Why or why not?

This solution is not a pure function. This function will affect code outside of the function. meaning it is not pure.
however the data will not be changed only flattened out in an array. So you could make a case that it is a pure function.

Is this solution a higher order function? Why or why not?

This is a higher oreder function as it returns another function. 
in python the code sorted() is a function. which means our function returns another function making it a higher order function.

Would it have been easier to solve this problem using a different programming style?

probably not but I don't know I am hardly experienced in any of the programing styles

Why in particular is functional programming a helpful paradigm when solving this problem?

Just write the function to change the data no need to create a class and methods.
