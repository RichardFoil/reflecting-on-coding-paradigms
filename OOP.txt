How does this solution demonstrate the four pillars of OOP? (It may not demonstrate all of them, describe only those that apply)

Encapsulation :  The podracer class Encapsulates max_speed, condition, and pricing of the racer. This is Encapsulation
Abstraction : Only the data that the user needs will show up. hopefully in the full code they have a few more important items that would finish classifiying their racers. however only certain pieces of the information needs to be shared with the user. This is Abstraction
Inheritance: Both anakins and sebulbas podracers inherit the podracer class in their own classes.Polymorphism:

Would it have been easier to implement a solution to this problem using a different coding style? Why or why not?

No, i don't know any other coding styles that would allow you to define classes and methods within those classes. 

How in particular did Object Oriented Programming assist in the solving of this problem?

This code needs a lot more information to actually make it effective. this "solution" to the problem didn't do anything except set up a couple of classes. 
Nothing has been solved or fixed or made into a working application
